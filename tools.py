Risk Level Explanation:
{risk_level}/10 - High risk due to:
1. Uses same receptor as SARS-CoV-2, indicating high potential for human transmission
2. Related to MERS virus, suggesting potential severity
3. No human cases yet, but preparedness is crucial
4. Existing coronavirus treatments might help but specific treatments not yet developed"""
