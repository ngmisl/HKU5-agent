      "risk_assessment": "Here is the final answer from your managed agent 'None':\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\nHKU5 risk assessment completed.\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nRISK_LEVEL: 4\nTRANSMISSION: HKU5 can infect human cells via ACE2 receptors, like SARS-CoV-2, but its transmissibility is believed to be lower.  It is of bat-origin. The virus has been found in China.\nMORTALITY: Mortality rates aren't available from the web search results, and no outbreaks have been reported.\nMUTATION: HKU5 is under research, and genetic analysis is ongoing, with potential for mutation. However, the provided information does not indicate the mutation rate or specific mutations observed.\nCONTAINMENT: No specific containment measures were mentioned in search results, although the research suggests it's being monitored.\nTREATMENT: No treatments or vaccines are mentioned in the search results.\nSUMMARY: HKU5 is a bat coronavirus with the ability to infect human cells. Further research and surveillance is needed. The overall risk is currently considered low but requires monitoring.\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe risk assessment is based on limited online information and requires more data.  A higher risk level would be assigned upon any confirmed/suspected human to human transmission. Lack of outbreak data limits the assessment, and no direct containment measures are known.."

      "risk_assessment": "Here is the final answer from your managed agent 'None':\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\nRisk assessment of H5N1 completed.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nThe risk assessment yielded the following:\nRISK_LEVEL: 3 (Low risk to the general public, but potential for higher risk due to animal outbreaks)\nTRANSMISSION: Primarily through direct contact with infected birds or contaminated environments. Dairy herd outbreaks present a new pathway.\nMORTALITY: High. CFR of 49% based on past data.\nMUTATION: The virus is known to mutate, with concern about adaptation to mammals.\nCONTAINMENT: Containment efforts are focused on surveillance, biosecurity and rapid response.\nTREATMENT: Antivirals available, vaccine development ongoing.\nSUMMARY: Low risk overall, monitoring for mutation and broader transmission pathways.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nAssessment incorporates information from CDC, PAHO and summarized outbreak data as of February 25, 2025. The risk level is based on the low human to human transmission. The risk could evolve to be higher as more data comes available. The recent discovery of dairy herd outbreaks is a point of concern that must be carefully observed."
