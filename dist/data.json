      "risk_assessment": {
        "risk_level": 4,
        "transmission": "HKU5-CoV-2 utilizes human ACE2 receptors, similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating a potential for animal-to-human transmission. It has been shown to infect human cell cultures in lab settings. The furin cleavage site also seems to be involved like in SARS-CoV-2, reinforcing its capacity to enter cells. However, it does not enter human cells as readily as SARS-CoV-2 and has lower binding affinity. No confirmed cases in humans have been reported. This creates uncertainty, but it is not negligible.",
        "mortality": "Information available indicates a similarity to MERS-CoV, which carries a high mortality rate (approximately 35%). Some articles compare it to the severity of SARS-CoV-2. However, there is no current mortality information related to the new virus itself and its potential impacts on humans are unknown. This indicates that the mortality rate from this virus is currently also unknown.",
        "mutation": "The mutation potential of HKU5-CoV-2 is not explicitly discussed within the search results beyond the identification of some variations of the RBD. However, coronaviruses generally have a propensity to mutate, and further investigation is required to ascertain specific mutation rates and potential for immune escape or increased virulence.",
        "containment": "There are no current containment measures listed for HKU5-CoV-2, as no cases have been reported in humans. The virus has been actively researched in China by the Wuhan Institute of Virology.",
        "treatment": "No specific treatments have been identified, but research is underway. Some research mentions protease inhibitors under evaluation, but they may not be effective.",
        "summary": "HKU5-CoV-2 poses a moderate risk due to its potential for human transmission based on the articles: its ability to bind to human ACE2 receptors and furin cleavage site. However, its lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-2 is positive. The lack of confirmed human cases, and the unknown mortality rate, coupled with uncertain mutation potentials justify the moderate risk level. Further monitoring and research are required."

        "risk_level": "5",
        "transmission": "The risk of human-to-human transmission appears to be low, but there is increasing evidence of the virus spreading to humans through animal contact, most notably dairy workers. The virus has been found in dairy cattle, suggesting a novel transmission pathway. The potential for widespread outbreaks is present, especially given the spread to all 50 states.",
        "mortality": "While most recent human cases have been mild, some cases have led to hospitalization and the overall risk of mortality remains. The provided data suggests a relatively low mortality rate in human cases observed to date, but doesn't exclude a potential surge in the future. There were 66 confirmed cases and 7 probable cases of influenza in people in the U.S.",
        "mutation": "The potential for the virus to mutate and increase its transmissibility or virulence is a key concern. Experts are actively monitoring the situation for changes. The discovery of new strains like B3.13 and the unusual cluster of cases in Colorado highlight the potential for mutation.",
        "containment": "Containment efforts are ongoing but face challenges due to the widespread presence of H5N1 in wild birds, poultry, and dairy cattle. The CDC is working with multiple agencies and states. The virus has been confirmed in dairy herds across 16 states. The scale of the outbreak is becoming increasingly large, making complete containment more difficult.",
        "treatment": "Antiviral medications are available, but early detection and rapid treatment are crucial for managing human cases. Information on the availability and effectiveness of specific treatments hasn't been significantly discussed in the search results.",
        "summary": "The overall risk is moderate, but the situation needs to be continuously monitored due to the virus's spread to new species and the potential for mutation. While human-to-human transmission is currently low, contact with infected animals is a growing concern, and the situation is evolving rapidly."
