        "mutation": "The potential for mutation is not directly discussed in the provided information, but coronaviruses generally have a capacity for mutation.",
        "containment": "No containment strategies are directly discussed, but researchers are studying the virus. Early detection and surveillance is key.",
        "treatment": "No specific treatments are mentioned. The development of vaccines may be possible.",
        "summary": "HKU5 presents a moderate risk due to its potential to infect human cells. No human cases have been reported yet. Further research is needed to fully understand transmission, mortality, mutation, and effective containment and treatment strategies. Considering the virus is similar to COVID but no human infections are known and research is ongoing, the risk remains moderate. The assessment is based solely on the provided news articles and scientific reports. The risk level is an estimate, as more data will be needed to fully classify the risks of HKU5. The provided articles suggest this virus has properties similar to the COVID-19 virus and thus warrants further investigation."

      "risk_assessment": {
        "risk_level": 7,
        "transmission": "H5N1 exhibits efficient transmission among birds and poultry, with increasing evidence of spillover into mammals (including rats, deer, and cows). Human transmission is currently sporadic, but adaptation to mammals including humans is a concern, given the detection of a variant in cows. The virus has been found in multiple states and even countries.",
        "mortality": "Mortality rates are high in both birds and humans. A death in the United States has been reported as well as severe illness in other human cases. This highlights the potential for severe outcomes.",
        "mutation": "H5N1 is known to mutate, and a variant has been found in cows, suggesting possible adaptation and increased potential for spread in mammals/humans.",
        "containment": "Containment efforts are ongoing, including monitoring, surveillance, and culling infected birds and poultry. Containment is challenging due to the wide geographic distribution of the virus and its presence in wild birds, which act as reservoirs and could cause further outbreaks.",
        "treatment": "Antiviral treatments (e.g., oseltamivir) are available, but their effectiveness is dependent on early administration and could be limited, particularly if resistance develops or the virus mutates. Prophylactic measures.",
        "summary": "The overall risk is elevated due to the virus's wide spread, zoonotic potential (including the recent spread to mammals), high mortality rate, and mutation potential. Continuous monitoring and research are crucial to address the evolving nature of the virus and prevent further outbreaks. The assessment is based on information available up to February 26, 2025. Updated information should be incorporated to adjust the assessment. The situation is dynamic and requires continuous surveillance. Anti-vax sentiments might also impact the public health response."
