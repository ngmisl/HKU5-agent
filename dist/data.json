      "risk_assessment": "Here is the final answer from your managed agent 'None':\n### 1. Task outcome (short version): Provided a risk assessment for HKU5 based on the given information.\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):  Detailed assessment, comprising risk level, transmission analysis, mortality analysis, mutation analysis, containment analysis, treatment options, and a summary, as requested in the specified format.\nRISK_LEVEL: 3\nTRANSMISSION: Potential for human transmission exists due to ACE2 receptor interaction. However, no confirmed human cases are mentioned in the provided summary. Transmission is therefore considered low risk at this time.\nMORTALITY: Mortality rates are currently unknown as there are no reported cases of human infection. Risk seems low.\nMUTATION: Coronaviruses are known to mutate. The mutation potential is present though, but is speculative based on the limited information. More research is needed.\nCONTAINMENT: Current containment status is unknown as the virus seems to exist naturally. Containment efforts would need to focus on preventing spillover to humans.\nTREATMENT: There are no specific treatments mentioned since no human cases are reported. Research into potential treatments should be conducted.\nSUMMARY: HKU5 poses a low to moderate risk based on its potential to infect human cells, but limited data on transmission, mortality, and specific mutations.\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant): The assessment is based solely on the provided information; further research necessary for clinical risk."

    "H5N1": {
      "risk_assessment": "Here is the final answer from your managed agent 'None':\n### 1. Task outcome (short version):\nH5N1 risk assessed and presented in requested format.\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\nA H5N1 risk assessment was performed by leveraging a base information summary and a web search of current scientific reports. The assessment includes RISK_LEVEL, TRANSMISSION, MORTALITY, MUTATION, CONTAINMENT, TREATMENT, and SUMMARY, reflecting the current understanding of H5N1 as of June 27, 2024. Data compiled from the provided summary and additional web search to fill gaps using reports from authorities like the CDC and WHO. The main finding is that for most of the general population, the risk level continues to be low, with a constant monitoring required. The risk assessment was formatted to match the format as requested by my manager.\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\nThe constant mutation potential in the H5N1 strain necessitates ongoing surveillance and adaptations to public health measures. The recent spillover events affecting cattle have brought a new element of complexity to the situation, requiring continuous reassessment of potential transmission patterns and risk dynamics.\nHere's the risk assessment summary:\nRISK_LEVEL: 3 (Based on CDC & WHO assessments, remaining low overall)\nTRANSMISSION: Transmission risk is considered low to the general public. However, those working with infected animals are at increased risk.\nMORTALITY: While the general public is under low risk, human mortality can be significant for those infected, but the case numbers are very low overall.\nMUTATION: The virus has mutation potential, particularly within the 2.3.4.4b clade, requiring continuous monitoring.\nCONTAINMENT: Containment efforts and monitoring are in place, but ongoing vigilance is needed, including in cattle populations.\nTREATMENT: Antiviral treatments may be available.\nSUMMARY: The overall risk to the general public is currently considered low, but requires continuing monitoring and assessment, due to the virus's mutation potential and outbreaks in new host species, such as cattle."
